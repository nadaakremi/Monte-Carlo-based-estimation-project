# Monte-Carlo-based-estimation-project
In this project, I estimated a stochastic-process-based ( verifying a Stochastic differential equation) expected value of a given function using numerical methods namely Monte Carlo method, and I tried to reduce the variance of the estimator using the antithetic method, control variates method and stratification method.
